# Automating Minecraft Server Setup on AWS

## Background
This tutorial will guide you through automating the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of a Minecraft server on AWS. We will use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Ansible for configuration management, and Docker for container management. By the end, you will have a fully automated pipeline that sets up an EC2 instance, installs Docker, deploys a Minecraft server container, and ensures the server restarts automatically on instance reboot.
